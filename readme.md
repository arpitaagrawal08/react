# React Practice Projects 🛠️

This repository contains small React projects I built while learning the fundamentals of React.

Projects include:
- To-Do List 📝
- Background Theme Switcher 🎨
- And more mini experiments...

These helped me get comfortable with components, hooks, and props.  
Feel free to explore or fork!
